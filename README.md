Using express und node.js's http library.

Pulling data from [UpTimeRobot](http://uptimerobot.com)

If you want to run this app locally on your machine make sure to create a file called `.env` with these contents:

```
APIKEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

and start it by using `foreman start`.

If you want to start it without the Heroku Toolbelt you have to put this env variable somewhere in your current session.

You can put it in any of your `.profile`'s or EXPORT it simply. This is up to you!

Happy Hacking
